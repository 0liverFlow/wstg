## OWASP Testing Guide
In terms of technical security testing execution, the OWASP testing guides are highly recommended. Depend on the types of the applications, the testing guides are listed below for the web/cloud services, Mobile APP (Android/iOS) or the IoT firmware respectively.

## Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
PTES defines penetration testing as 7 phases. Particularly, PTES Technical Guidelines give hands-on suggestions on testing procedures, and recommendation for security testing tools.

- Pre-engagement Interactions
- Intelligence Gathering
- Threat Modeling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

## PCI Penetration Testing Guide

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirement 11.3 defines the penetration testing. PCI also defines Penetration Testing Guidance.

### PCI DSS Penetration Testing Guidance

The PCI DSS Penetration testing guideline provides the methodology 

- Penetration Testing Components
- Qualifications of a Penetration Tester
- Penetration Testing Methodologies
- Penetration Testing Reporting Guidelines

### PCI DSS Penetration Testing Requirements

The PCI DSS requirement refer to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirement 11.3

- Based on industry-accepted approaches
- Coverage for CDE and critical systems
- Includes external and internal testing
- Test to validate scope reduction
- Application-layer testing
- Network-layer tests for network and OS

## Penetration Testing Framework (PTF)

The Penetration testing framework provides comprehensive hands-on penetration testing guide. It also lists usages of the security testing tools in each testing category. The major area of penetration testing includes -

- Network Foot-printing (Reconnaissance)
- Discovery & Probing
- Enumeration
- Password cracking
- Vulnerability Assessment
- AS/400 Auditing
- Bluetooth Specific Testing
- Cisco Specific Testing
- Citrix Specific Testing
- Network Backbone
- Server Specific Tests
- VoIP Security
- Wireless Penetration
- Physical Security
- Final Report - template

## Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (NIST 800-115)
Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment was published by NIST U.S. Department of Commerce. There are some assessment techniques suggested by the NIST 800-115 listed below.

- Review Techniques
- Target Identification and Analysis Techniques
- Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques 
- Security Assessment Planning
- Security Assessment Execution
- Post-Testing Activities

The NIST 800-115 can be accessed [here]( https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-115/final)

## Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

The ISSAF which was previously supported by Open Information Systems Security Group (OISSG) and was not an active community. However, it provides the following specific scenario-based security assessment.

- Database Security Assessment
- WLAN Security Assessment
- Switch Security Assessment
- Router Security Assessment
- Firewall Security Assessment
- Intrusion Detection System Security Assessment
- VPN Security Assessment
- Storage Area Network (SAN) Security Assessment

Refer to the ISSAF Chapter 7 for the listed security assessment above.

## Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

OSSTMM is a methodology to test the operational security of physical locations, workflow, human security testing, physical security testing, wireless security testing, telecommunication security testing, data networks security testing and compliance. OSSTMM can be supporting reference of IOS 27001 instead of a hands-on or technical application penetration testing guide. 

OSSTMM includes the following key sections:
- Security Analysis
- Operational Security Metrics
- Trust Analysis
- Work Flow.
- Human Security Testing
- Physical Security Testing
- Wireless Security Testing
- Telecommunications Security Testing
- Data Networks Security Testing
- Compliance Regulations
- Reporting with the STAR (Security Test Audit Report)
