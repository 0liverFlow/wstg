## WHAT
The OWASP Testing Guide v4 includes a “best practice” penetration testing framework which users can implement in their own organisations. The Testing Guide v4 also includes a “low level” penetration testing guide that describes techniques for testing the most common web application and web service security issues. Today the Testing Guide is the standard to perform Web Application Penetration Testing, and many companies around the world have adopted it. It is vital to maintain an updated project that represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

The aim of the Working Session is to discuss and define the scope and content of OWASP Testing Guide v5.
